The first thing you notice is that it‚Äôs cold‚Äîthe type that sinks into your bones and replaces any lingering warmth that you might‚Äôve retained from the tattered cloak that covers you. Next is the roughness of the concrete on the side of your face and on your hands as you hoist yourself up. 

Dawn has just blinked away the remnants of sleep. If the rumbling of your stomach has anything to say about it, you can guess that you‚Äôve been asleep for quite some time.

You look around only to see that you are at the dead end of an empty and dimly lit alleyway. Dirt, dust, and trash surround you. All things considered, it‚Äôs fairly clean. You pull yourself up, slowly and clumsily making your way out of the alley, shaking away the fatigue.

As you stumble towards its end, you arrive near a low building. You can just read a sign that obnoxiously displays ‚ÄúStackler‚Äôs Steakhouse‚Äù. It is one of the most popular places in town. From where you are, the sweet aroma of freshly baked bread, and the sizzling of a well-seasoned steak being placed in a hot pan causes your stomach to rumble fiercely. The smells are mouthwatering.

You can‚Äôt help but notice as a woman walks into the building. She is dressed well: pearls, elbow length gloves, and a simple black dress. She walks in without interference. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be a check-in system. Your stomach growls once more.

Your gaze falls towards the back of the building. Just beyond a dumpster are two figures cloaked in darkness. They begin to walk away quickly as you continue to approach the area. One of them hands the other a vile; your attention, however, focuses on the dumpster.

You could dig through it for some food. It would be a terrible experience, but surely you could find something to eat‚Ä¶ right?
[[Go to the Dumpster.|Dumpster Visit I]]

But you could also go into the building and ask for a loaf of bread‚Äîor something, anything‚Ä¶ surely they‚Äôd help.
[[Go to Stackler's.|Restaurant]]


:: Restaurant {"position":"876,248","size":"100,100"}
You go inside the building! Gingerly, you approach the entrance. Opening the door leaves you standing there in the midst of finery. Warm air embraces you and the smells from outside are a thousand times stronger. You walk in further‚Äîno one bothers you. Further once more‚Äîno one. You are now almost at a table already set with food. A nice warm meal awaits you. You walk closer and‚Äî

‚Äú‚ÄîExcuse me sir, I‚Äôm sorry but you are not allowed in here.‚Äù An accented voice interrupts you. The host‚Äîa large, aged man‚Äîwho had just rounded the corner after seating the previous customer (a familiar lady wearing pearls) walks up to you and starts pushing you out the door. Instantly, you are back in the cold.

You have been here before, kicked out in the cold‚Äîso many times that you are neither indignant nor defeated (some would mistake the look on your face for defiance).

As you hobble away from the building, a couple also wearing fine clothes, walks right past you. Another customer for the host to welcome...

You could go back in, steal some food, and be out before the host notices you there. 
[[Return Inside.|Return to Restaurant]]

You could continue to walk away and scavenge in that dumpster you saw earlier.
[[Return to the Dumpster|Dumpster Visit II]]


:: Dumpster Visit II {"position":"1008,546","size":"100,100"}
Well, it‚Äôs probably not worth it to go back in anyways. You look away from the building; instead, you make your way back to the dumpster you saw earlier. Your stomach growls once more. It wouldn‚Äôt hurt to look‚Ä¶

<<set $stink += 21>>

You rummage through the dumpster, and in doing so, you don‚Äôt hear the backdoor of the building open. Neither do you see the large figure of the host taking out the garbage. He spots you and yells:

‚ÄúHEY‚Äîwhat‚Äôre you‚Ä¶ wait, you‚Äôre that rat that snuck into our fine establishment earlier. I told you to shoo! Get away, you!!‚Äù

The man runs towards you with the trash bag braced in his hands.

‚ÄúGet‚ÄîsmACK!‚Äîaway‚ÄîsMACK!!‚Äîfrom‚ÄîSMACK!!!‚Äîhere!‚Äù

You manage to flee, and while doing so, you rub your left chin and grimace ‚Äî that‚Äôs bound to bruise.

Sighing, you come to a stop, warily looking around. It seems that the host didn't follow you - much to your relief. Something catches your eye, however. Hanging patiently on the wall of an opposing building is a poster. You read:

As you back away from the dumpster, a poster on the wall of the building catches your attention:

:: Return to Restaurant {"position":"800,398","size":"100,100"}
You wait about half a minute before following after the couple. The host is gone from his usual station. Your gaze falls back to the warm meal on the table. The steak is practically off the frying pan, sizzling and steaming hot. There are guests all around, though, and there is no way that you wouldn‚Äôt be seen. You glance back at the door behind you.

[[Steal the steak and RUN!|Steal]]

/*TODO: Add plate to inventory, once inventory gets implemented*/
Your hunger is now satiated; the steak practically melted in your mouth - you even got the plate! Something catches your attention from the corner of your eye. A poster near the back of the building hangs patiently. You read:

:: Stealth {"position":"874,549","size":"100,100"}
With the eyes of wealthy patrons following your back, you sneak further in. The clashing and clinking of silverware hints that you‚Äôre sneaking in the right direction. You come to a door half ajar. As you peer into what you presume is the kitchen, you make eye contact with the host in the middle of reaching towards a garbage bag. He freezes, and his face reminds you of a tomato as he recognizes you. 

‚ÄúYou! What are you doing here?? Out! OUT I SAY!‚Äù  He yells as he grabs a silver platter. The man then runs at you, and you have barely a second before‚Äî

‚ÄîSMACK!

Three strikes of the platter hit your shoulder, side, and lower chin. You are thrown out the back door before you know it, right into the very dumpster you were staring at before. You rub at your chin‚Ä¶ that is sure to bruise, colourfully. You gingerly climb out of the dumpster, still hungry and now smelling of garbage. Fantastic.

<<set $health -= 20>>

Rubbing your chin, you look around warily. Something catches your eye. Hanging patiently, on the very building you were kicked out of, is a poster. You read:

:: Good Ending {"position":"1525,1875","size":"100,100"}
Congratulations, due to your painstaking efforts you somehow managed to save up enough to feed, cloth, clean, and shelter yourself while looking for a stable job. Now that you are not so stinky and unreliable looking, employers are less reluctant to dismiss you so easily. You are finally free from a life of poor hygiene, but otherwise, the rising cost of living has made the differences appear to be aesthetic at best.

/*Congratulations, you managed to overcome your addiction! You are finally free from the world of fantasy that kept you sane and now you have the opportunity to experience the joys of being unhoused in a modern city instead of a medieval one.

Did you think you would get a job smelling and looking like that? Tough luck.

<<if $hunger > 0>>
	You feel your stomach burning as you scavenge the streets for something to eat. Unfortunately, there's nothing around, and generosity seems to be absent from the hearts of the people today. Your vision starts to blur. You know this feeling. You've experienced it many times before. Better head back to your shelter before you pass out.
<<else>>
	Well, at least you managed to find something to eat. For now...
    
    Thinking that you may not be so lucky tomorrow, you spend the rest of the rest of the day looking for more food to bring home. Unfortunately, you did not find anything, and it is already getting late. This area is not the safest at night.
    
    Better head back to your shelter before something unfortunate happens.

It seems the employers must have been quite desperate this time, since even you got hired.

Well, it was only a temporary one day deal, but still, you have some money in your pocket now.

Hey, maybe you won't even need to steal your food tomorrow!

The posting was not making an understatement when it said "LABOUR INTENSIVE" though. The job lasted all day, leaving you exhausted and hungry again. But still, you cannot help but feel excited. Things are looking up.

There‚Äôs a bottle in your hand. It‚Äôs glass cold against your palm as your stare at the pearlescent, glitter-filled liquid within. Temptation in all its glory.  

There‚Äôs a phantom pain in your left knee, pulsing and burrowing into your bones - angrily tearing into the ligament. It isn‚Äôt physically real, you should know this, but, right now, it‚Äôs everything but fake. Right now, it‚Äôs real to you. 

There‚Äôs a stray black cat digging through the dustbins beside you. It seems like you both share the same predicament. It stops, as if sensing your musings, and runs off. You sigh as you lay your head against the brick wall you‚Äôre resting against. The distraction doesn‚Äôt last very long before another aching pain travels out from your knee. Damn your old injury.

You feel nice and comfortable and warm. It‚Äôs so relaxing, you could just shut your eyes here‚Ä¶

[[Fight It]]

[[Give In]]


:: Fight It {"position":"1498,800","size":"100,100"}
You feel your eyes start to close, and you fight it with all your might. Forcing open your eyes seems to give a little shock to your heart and a headache slowly starts forming behind them. Falling asleep here would do you no good.

[[Get Up]]

[[Give In]]


:: Give In {"position":"1698,801","size":"100,100"}
There‚Äôs nothing here.

At first.

You can vaguely recall glimpses of a time encased in golden tones. A wistful memory perhaps. Something before the accident - before you were offered promises and lies coated in cotton candy and peppermint.

[[...]]


:: Get Up {"position":"1499,997","size":"100,100"}
You struggle to your feet, carefully tucking the Elixir away in one of the inner parts of your cloak. As you stand, you can definitely feel it start to kick in. You feel rejuvenated, fresh, fantastic! Like you could do anything and everything. Better yet, your knee doesn‚Äôt hurt anymore. You hop around, feeling a little silly. It doesn‚Äôt matter, heck, you feel like you could fly!

You stumble forward, and as you do so, you trip a little bit. Over what, you ask? Nothing that you can see. You even stubbed your toe! Not that you could feel it right now - the pain (you can still feel your toes, don‚Äôt worry!)

Oh, look. The cat has returned. It looks at you curiously. To you, its fur looks particularly soft.

You feel pleasantly light as you stagger towards the cat, hands reaching out. Nothing can touch you -  you‚Äôre the strongest person alive! Nothing can even try to stop‚Äî!!!

THUD

[[Give In]]


:: ... {"position":"1700,1100","size":"100,100"}
You come to slumped over, feeling as if ice is coursing through your veins. You can immediately tell that a couple of hours have passed. The taste of peppermint coats your tongue despite being out for about a half hour. Your skin is clammy and cold. You flex your hand - it feels weak and sluggish.

There‚Äôs something else, though, something soft laying across our legs. You look up. The eyes of a black cat bores into your own. 

‚ÄúExcuse my intrusion,‚Äù It says.

You blink once. Then twice, before yelping and launching the cat from your lap.

It hisses angrily at you, and scuttles off. Hm, perhaps you imagined that.

[[Take Elixir]]

[[Leave the Elixir]]


:: Take Elixir {"position":"2902,299","size":"100,100"}
The Elixir washes over you as you take it. Cotton candy sprouts from your insides like fungus, and peppermints are the spores they release. They spread throughout your entire body, and you no longer feel any pain. You sit down, relaxed.

[[Wait.|Wait3]]


:: Leave the Elixir {"position":"3102,297","size":"100,100"}
You step away from the body resting in the dark alleyway, mentally restraining yourself. You won‚Äôt do it. Each step backwards hosts its own individual weight‚Äìthousands of tonnes of invisible force pushing against you. You‚Äôll only make it so far. 

Luck would have it, though, that as you walk backwards, slowly stepping into the sunlit streets of the neighbourhood, someone calls out to you. 

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù The stranger calls out. You whip your head around, distracted for at least a moment. Recognition instantly flashes across your face as an old family friend hobbles over to you. 

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen you in ages! You‚Äì‚Äù he looks you up and down, ‚Äú--would you like to catch up over coffee? Something warm perhaps?‚Äù He sounds old, worried.

[[You know what? Sure, why not?]]

[[I‚Äôve got something to... uh, do‚Ä¶ maybe next time.]]


:: Wait3 {"position":"2902,499","size":"100,100"}
You feel much better now. Warm and fuzzy and nice. 

[[Wait.|Wait4]]


:: Wait4 {"position":"2902,602","size":"100,100"}
You glance down at the body beside you. You should probably call for some help, but you just feel so comfortable‚Äîand it has been a while. You look away, leaning the back of your head against the wall. Taking a moment to yourself. You breathe deeply.

[[Close Your Eyes]]


:: Close Your Eyes {"position":"2902,797","size":"100,100"}
You come to a few hours later, having fallen asleep. Your stomach is empty, and you feel cold. You feel goosebumps across your entire body as a shiver runs up your spine. There is still some Elixir left in the bottle. You sigh before stretching your neck and back and looking around. The body beside you is untouched and unmoving; you glance at it briefly before looking away. It winks at you. 

Wait, hold on‚Äì

You do a double take.

The corpse on the ground is staring back at you‚Äì eyes wide open and pupils dilated. You place the Elixir down beside you to rub at your eyes. Surely they‚Äôre not open, right? No, no they‚Äôre definitely open. And as the loosened jaw of your recently deceased acquaintance starts to move, you cry out and scramble back to your feet. 

It‚Äôs alive?! 

It‚Äôs ALIVE!? 

You think you see it start to blink and reach out towards you. Nothing else moves, but that‚Äôs enough for you. You dart out of the darkened alleyway‚Äìwell, not before creeping forward to snatch the Elixir you placed down. You could swear it tried to crawl closer to you when you did.

Anyways, it‚Äôs a good thing you got out of there before your (not-so)-zombie friend could turn you too, but it‚Äôs also a shame that you couldn‚Äôt hear the greeting of a familiar face down the road. Quite unfortunate.

<<link "...">><<PassOutHigh 0.25>><</link>>		/*TODO: Make the severity (currently 0.25) depend on choices in the dialogue, and/or a minigame. */


:: You know what? Sure, why not? {"position":"3035,607","size":"100,100"}
You spend the rest of the day talking with an old friend. I wish you could see your heavy eyes lighten as he did. The coffee was nice. You two plan to do this more often. For now, though, it‚Äôs time for you to head back - it‚Äôs getting dark.

The man visibly dims, frowning briefly. ‚ÄúWell, if you ever need me, I‚Äôm just off of 123 Purdue Lane. Perhaps we‚Äôll pass each other again.‚Äù He hobbles past you, patting your shoulder in farewell. You stand there for a little bit, contemplating. But anyways! It‚Äôs about time to do‚Ä¶ Well, whatever you were planning to do. Shall we?
