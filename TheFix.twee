The first thing you notice is that it‚Äôs cold‚Äîthe type that sinks into your bones and replaces any lingering warmth that you might‚Äôve retained from the tattered cloak that covers you. Next is the roughness of the concrete on the side of your face and on your hands as you hoist yourself up. 

Dawn has just blinked away the remnants of sleep. If the rumbling of your stomach has anything to say about it, you can guess that you‚Äôve been asleep for quite some time.

You look around only to see that you are at the dead end of an empty and dimly lit alleyway. Dirt, dust, and trash surround you. All things considered, it‚Äôs fairly clean. You pull yourself up, slowly and clumsily making your way out of the alley, shaking away the fatigue.

As you stumble towards its end, you arrive near a low building. You can just read a sign that obnoxiously displays ‚ÄúStackler‚Äôs Steakhouse‚Äù. It is one of the most popular places in town. From where you are, the sweet aroma of freshly baked bread, and the sizzling of a well-seasoned steak being placed in a hot pan causes your stomach to rumble fiercely. The smells are mouthwatering.

You can‚Äôt help but notice as a woman walks into the building. She is dressed well: pearls, elbow length gloves, and a simple black dress. She walks in without interference. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be a check-in system. Your stomach growls once more.

Your gaze falls towards the back of the building. Just beyond a dumpster are two figures cloaked in darkness. They begin to walk away quickly as you continue to approach the area. One of them hands the other a small baggie filled with a fluffy pinkish beige powder; your attention, however, focuses on the dumpster.


You could dig through it for some food. It would be a terrible experience, but surely you could find something to eat‚Ä¶ right?

You go inside the building! Gingerly, you approach the entrance. Opening the door leaves you standing there in the midst of finery. Warm air embraces you and the smells from outside are a thousand times stronger. You walk in further‚Äîno one bothers you. Further once more‚Äîno one. You are now almost at a table already set with food. A nice warm meal awaits you. You walk closer and‚Äî

‚Äú‚ÄîExcuse me sir, I‚Äôm sorry but you are not allowed in here.‚Äù An accented voice interrupts you. The host‚Äîa large, aged man‚Äîwho had just rounded the corner after seating the previous customer (a familiar lady wearing pearls) walks up to you and starts pushing you out the door. Instantly, you are back in the cold.

You have been here before, kicked out in the cold‚Äîso many times that you are neither indignant nor defeated (some would mistake the look on your face for defiance).

As you hobble away from the building, a couple also wearing fine clothes, walks right past you. Another customer for the host to welcome...

You could go back in, steal some food, and be out before the host notices you there.

Well, it‚Äôs probably not worth it to go back in anyways. You look away from the building; instead, you make your way back to the dumpster you saw earlier. Your stomach growls once more. It wouldn‚Äôt hurt to look‚Ä¶

<<set $stink += 21>>

You rummage through the dumpster, and in doing so, you don‚Äôt hear the backdoor of the building open. Neither do you see the large figure of the host taking out the garbage. He spots you and yells:

‚ÄúHEY‚Äîwhat‚Äôre you‚Ä¶ wait, you‚Äôre that rat that snuck into our fine establishment earlier. I told you to shoo! Get away, you!!‚Äù

The man runs towards you with the trash bag braced in his hands.

‚ÄúGet‚ÄîsmACK!‚Äîaway‚ÄîsMACK!!‚Äîfrom‚ÄîSMACK!!!‚Äîhere!‚Äù

You manage to flee, and while doing so, you rub your left chin and grimace ‚Äî that‚Äôs bound to bruise.

Sighing, you come to a stop, warily looking around. It seems that the host didn't follow you - much to your relief. Something catches your eye, however. Hanging patiently on the wall of an opposing building is a poster. You read:

You wait about half a minute before following after the couple. The host is gone from his usual station. Your gaze falls back to the warm meal on the table. The steak is practically off the frying pan, sizzling and steaming hot. There are guests all around, though, and there is no way that you wouldn‚Äôt be seen. You glance back at the door behind you.

With the eyes of wealthy patrons following your back, you sneak further in. The clashing and clinking of silverware hints that you‚Äôre sneaking in the right direction. You come to a door half ajar. As you peer into what you presume is the kitchen, you make eye contact with the host in the middle of reaching towards a garbage bag. He freezes, and his face reminds you of a tomato as he recognizes you. 

‚ÄúYou! What are you doing here?? Out! OUT I SAY!‚Äù  He yells as he grabs a silver platter. The man then runs at you, and you have barely a second before‚Äî

‚ÄîSMACK!

Three strikes of the platter hit your shoulder, side, and lower chin. You are thrown out the back door before you know it, right into the very dumpster you were staring at before. You rub at your chin‚Ä¶ that is sure to bruise, colourfully. You gingerly climb out of the dumpster, still hungry and now smelling of garbage. Fantastic.

Congratulations, due to your painstaking efforts you somehow managed to save up enough to feed, cloth, clean, and shelter yourself while looking for a stable job. Now that you are not so stinky and unreliable looking, employers are less reluctant to dismiss you so easily. You are finally free from a life of poor hygiene, but otherwise, the rising cost of living has made the differences appear to be aesthetic at best.

/*Congratulations, you managed to overcome your addiction!

There‚Äôs a stray black cat digging through the dustbins beside you. It seems like you both share the same predicament. It stops, as if sensing your musings, and runs off. You sigh as you lay your head against the brick wall you‚Äôre resting against. The distraction doesn‚Äôt last very long before another aching pain travels out from your knee. Damn your old injury.

You struggle to your feet, carefully tucking Elixir away in one of the inner parts of your cloak. As you stand, you can definitely feel it start to kick in. You feel rejuvenated, fresh, fantastic! Like you could do anything and everything. Better yet, your knee doesn‚Äôt hurt anymore. You hop around, feeling a little silly. It doesn‚Äôt matter, heck, you feel like you could fly!

You stumble forward, and as you do so, you trip a little bit. Over what, you ask? Nothing that you can see. You even stubbed your toe! Not that you could feel it right now‚Äîthe pain (you can still feel your toes, don‚Äôt worry!)

Oh, look. The cat has returned. It looks at you curiously. To you, its fur looks particularly soft.

You feel pleasantly light as you stagger towards the cat, hands reaching out. Nothing can touch you‚Äîyou‚Äôre the strongest person alive! Nothing can even try to stop‚Äî!!!

You come to slumped over, feeling as if ice is coursing through your veins. You can immediately tell that a couple of hours have passed. The taste of peppermint coats your tongue despite being out for about a half hour. Your skin is clammy and cold. You flex your hand - it feels weak and sluggish.

There‚Äôs something else, though, something soft laying across our legs. You look up. The eyes of a black cat bores into your own. 

‚ÄúExcuse my intrusion,‚Äù It says.

You blink once. Then twice, before yelping and launching the cat from your lap.

It hisses angrily at you, and scuttles off. Hm, perhaps you imagined that.

Oh no, it appears this is our friend from earlier, he must be having a rough week.

But, I mean, how would he even know you were here, he probably won‚Äôt remember his last name tomorrow.

You‚Äôd probably be doing him a favour by relieving him of his Elixir, I mean, it seems like he can‚Äôt even handle it, he might hurt himself if he takes it again. Unfortunately, while you are stepping over him you notice that he has stopped breathing

Elixir washes over you as you take it immediately. You feel the soft sensation budding within your veins like delicate orchids, and a cool mentholated breeze of pollen erupts from this freshly planted flora.

You turn to look at your so-called ‚Äòfriend‚Äô and notice that he has stopped breathing. Now that you have stolen and injected yourself with his drugs, calling emergency services would be too risky. For a moment, you feel your stomach tighten from guilt.

Luck would have it, though, that as you walk backwards, slowly stepping into the sunlit streets of the neighbourhood, someone calls out to you. 

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù The stranger calls out. You whip your head around, distracted for at least a moment. Recognition instantly flashes across your face as your old uncle Warren hobbles over to you. He is dressed in a shiny perfectly-tailored suit that glistens under the bright fluorescent street lights. You haven‚Äôt seen him in years.

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen you in ages! You‚Äì‚Äù he looks you up and down, ‚Äú‚Äîwould you like to catch up over coffee? Something warm perhaps?‚Äù He talks and talks but doesn‚Äôt seem to be listening.

You come to a few hours later, having fallen asleep. Your stomach is empty, and you feel cold. You feel goosebumps across your entire body as a shiver runs up your spine. There is still some Elixir left in the syringe. You sigh before stretching your neck and back and looking around. The body beside you is untouched and unmoving; you glance at it briefly before looking away. It winks at you. 

Wait, hold on‚Äì

You do a double take.

The corpse on the ground is staring back at you‚Äìeyes wide open and pupils dilated. You place the syringe down beside you to rub at your eyes. Surely they‚Äôre not open, right? No, no they‚Äôre definitely open. And as the loosened jaw of your unconscious acquaintance starts to move, you cry out and scramble back to your feet. 

He‚Äôs alive?! 

HE‚Äôs ALIVE!? 

You think you see him blink; perhaps his finger twitched? Nothing else moves, but that‚Äôs enough for you. You dart out of the darkened alleyway‚Äìwell, not before creeping forward to snatch the syringe you placed down. You could swear he moved his hand when you did.

Anyways, it‚Äôs a good thing you got out of there before your (not-so)-zombie friend could turn you too, but it‚Äôs also a shame that you missed a chance to catch up with a familiar face down the road. Quite unfortunate.

The smell of disinfectant fills your nostrils. Hospitals don't hold the best of memories for you. Flashbacks meld the feelings of a work injury and the Elixir. You grimace. Still, this is the best place for you to heal up, even if it costs a fortune (to you).

You place the entire bag into the cap of a water bottle, carefully mix it around, slowly pull the liquid into a lightly used syringe. You are immediately reunited with a familiar sensation of relief as your eyes become unbearably heavy, you close them for a moment and feel your body smoothly descending toward the ground. You feel the sweet caress of concrete as you begin to peacefully drift away into a tranquil state of relaxation.

You run for a few steps before stumbling on a curb, you cascade downward until your face is stopped by the cold, rough pavement of a cracked sidewalk. The police lightly chuckle as they put you into handcuffs and inform you that you will also be charged with resisting arrest

They ask you for your name, address, and date of birth

<<linkreplace lie>>You give the police a made up name and address which they call into the system for a record check using their loud, crackly walkie-talkies. A rumble comes through the speaker of the walkie-talkie and one of the officers informs you that they have found no record of you anywhere. They accuse you of lying and take you into custody for more questioning 

You arrive at the police station and wait in a brightly lit room for hours on end before they drag you into a dark room with a lamp. They ask you for your information again

The police officers take you into custody where you are swiftly booked and photographed before a guard strip searches you, demands you put on a bright orange jump-suit with a number on it and removes the tight metal handcuffs from your wrists 

Then he forces you into an 8‚Äô x 10‚Äô cell with concrete walls painted white and fluorescent lighting that reflects off the walls in a seeming attempt to blind you, this is not helped by the chrome seatless toilet that is placed perpendicular to the cold metal bed where you will be spending the next few day

The guards walk up and inform you that you will not have a court date until 16 months from now due to the backlog of cases in the court system and as such you will be staying in the county jail for over a year just to have your day in court, that is, unless you have $10,000 to pay your bond.

[[Wait in jail|Jail Ending]]


:: Jail Ending {"position":"2575,725","size":"100,100"}
You walk into the county jail where you feel the pain of withdrawals creeping into your bones. After weeks of incomprehensible suffering you are offered free medical care, three extremely poor quality meals per day, and a warm place to sleep. The only downside is the likely inability to get a job for the next 10 years due to your criminal record, the constant presence of violence while incarcerated, and the dehumanisation you will endure from guards, inmates, politicians, and voters. You will also be living under constant surveillance within an electric panopticon of CCTV cameras while subject to mandatory backbreaking slavery, an intentional byproduct of the 13th amendment. This is why you probably should have saved up that $10,000.
